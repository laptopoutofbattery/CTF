x86-64 assembly language
-
x86-64 refers to the 64-bit version of the x86 CPU architecture implemented by many CPU manufacturers.  
Assembly programs consist of an arrangement of instructions, which are executed by the CPU to interact with memory and registers.  
- Instructions are operations performed by the CPU
- Memory refers to virtual memory storage for the running program
- Registers are internal memory storage locations included in the processor (places that the processor can store memory, kind of like variables in code)

Some instructions: 
| Instruction | What it does|
|-------------|-------------|
| nop         | does nothing|
