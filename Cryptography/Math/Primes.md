Primes
-
Different types of primes can be used to exploit oracles and custom encryption scripts.

### AP Primes
The [Green-Tao theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%E2%80%93Tao_theorem) states that the prime numbers contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions.  
A sequence of $k$ primes in arthimetic progression can be written as AP- $k$ and can be expressed as $an+b$ for $0 \le n \le k-1$.
This site gives records of discovered AP- $k$ sequences: http://primerecords.dk/aprecords.htm

### Safe and Sophie Germain Primes
A [Sophie Germain prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_and_Sophie_Germain_primes) is defined as a prime number $p$ where $2p+1$ is also prime. In this case $2p+1$ is referred to as a safe prime.

### Gaussian Primes
Prime elements in the set of Gaussian integers $\mathbb Z[i]$. A Gaussian prime $z = a + bi$ satisfies one of the following properties:
- $a$ and $b$ are nonzero and $a^2+b^2$ (norm) is a prime number
- either $a$ or $b$ is zero and the absolute value of the other is a prime number of the form $4n + 3$ (congruent to 3 mod 4)
